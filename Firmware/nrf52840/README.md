# BC840M Zephyr
Working repository for the nRF52 Zephyr firmware, made for a [BC840M prototype](https://github.com/moothyknight/nRF52-Biosensing-Boards)

Recommended build tools: nRFConnect with VSCode.

You may need to manually install gnu-arm-embedded software. 

We used the nRF52 development board which is a J-LINK device for flashing. 

Was also able to use a 1 dollar STM32 blue pill to flash a built hex file manually.
